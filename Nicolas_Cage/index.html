            Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's
            love for you. Oh God, what have I done? Meh. I can explain. It's very valuable. Fetal stemcells, aren't those
            controversial? Now what? I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those
            things bring. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.

            No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Why did you bring us here? Just once I'd like to eat dinner with
            a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit…
            that's why I'm transferring to business school!
